## 🔐 Security & Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ All routes require valid JWT token
- ✅ Only FOUNDER role can create/update/delete
- ✅ Non-founders get 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Middleware protects `/app/*` routes

### Audit Logging
Every financial action is logged:
- `ASSET_CREATE / ASSET_UPDATE / ASSET_DELETE`
- `LIABILITY_CREATE / LIABILITY_UPDATE / LIABILITY_DELETE`
- `*_DENIED` for permission failures
- Metadata includes: name, category, amount, status
- Actor ID, IP address, user agent tracked

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas for all inputs
- Type validation (numbers, dates, enums)
- Range constraints (non-negative amounts)
- String length limits
- Detailed error messages

### Database Constraints
- Foreign key to users table (created_by)
- CHECK constraints for value ranges
- Enum validation for status fields
- Automatic timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Indexed for performance:
  - idx_assets_category, idx_assets_created_by
  - idx_liabilities_status, idx_liabilities_due_date
